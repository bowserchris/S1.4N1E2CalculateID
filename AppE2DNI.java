 * - Exercise 2	

    Create a class called CalculoDni that calculates 
    the letter of the DNI by receiving the number as a parameter.
    Create a jUnit class that verifies its correct operation, 
    parameterizing it so that the test receives a wide spectrum 
    of data and validates if the calculation is correct for 
    10 predefined ID numbers.
